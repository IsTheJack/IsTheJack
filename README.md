## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Roberto!

I'm a full-stack software engineer specializing in **Node**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **React Native**, but I'm open to working with any technology that makes sense for the project.

Before being a **full-stack engineer** building web apps, I see myself as a developer, and even before that, as a problem solver. I love digging deep into domains and coming up with practical solutions tailored to each projectâ€™s specifics.

Being full-stack means I'm ready to build end-to-end solutions. But I consider myself a bit differentâ€”I prefer using straightforward tools to quickly push high-quality code to production, with CI, tests, and other quality checks. At the same time, I enjoy the creative side of development and can handle UX/UI work using tools like Figma.

I'm always focused on balancing cost and value in any system. I aim to close the gap between business and tech. First and foremost, Iâ€™m a problem solver.

I'm not actively looking for a new position right now, but I'm always up for a chat.

ðŸ¤˜ If youâ€™re a recruiter, a good way to grab my attention? Start by telling me your favorite rock band at robertooliveira.dev@gmail.com.
